## Assets

### 1. Private Ed25519 Keys

**Description:** 32-byte Ed25519 private keys (seeds) used for signing operations

**Confidentiality:** CRITICAL
**Integrity:** CRITICAL
**Availability:** HIGH

**Impact of Compromise:**
- **Identity Theft:** Attacker can impersonate the agent/device
- **Signature Forgery:** Attacker can sign malicious JWS tokens on behalf of victim
- **Irrevocable:** `did:key` identifiers are cryptographically bound to keys - no revocation mechanism exists

**Storage Locations:**
- In-memory (during `AgentIdentity` object lifetime)
- Encrypted files (`FileKeyStore` - PBKDF2 + Fernet)
- Environment variables (`EnvKeyStore` - plaintext in process environment)
- External keystores (HSM, cloud KMS - future integration)

---

### 2. Encrypted Seed Files

**Description:** PBKDF2-derived Fernet-encrypted seed files stored by `FileKeyStore`

**Confidentiality:** HIGH
**Integrity:** MEDIUM
**Availability:** MEDIUM

**Impact of Compromise:**
- **Offline Brute-Force:** Attacker with file access can attempt password cracking
  - Mitigated by PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations as of v0.1.5)
  - Still vulnerable if weak passwords used
- **File Deletion:** Loss of encrypted seeds = permanent identity loss (no recovery)

**Storage Locations:**
- User-specified directories (default: `~/.didlite/keys/`)
- Cloud storage (if user mounts cloud drives)
- Backup systems

---

### 3. JWS Tokens (Signed JWT)

**Description:** Compact JWS tokens created by `create_jws()` containing signed payloads

**Confidentiality:** LOW (payloads are base64-encoded, not encrypted)
**Integrity:** CRITICAL (EdDSA signature protects against tampering)
**Availability:** LOW

**Impact of Compromise:**
- **Replay Attacks:** Intercepted tokens can be reused if no `exp` (expiration) claim
- **Payload Disclosure:** Sensitive data in payload visible to anyone (base64 is encoding, not encryption)
- **Signature Stripping:** If verifier doesn't validate signature, attacker can modify payload

**Transmission Channels:**
- HTTP/HTTPS (if used in web APIs)
- Message queues (MQTT, AMQP for IoT)
- Local inter-process communication
- Log files (if improperly logged)

---

### 4. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Description:** Public identifiers in format `did:key:z6Mkh...` derived from public keys

**Confidentiality:** N/A (public by design)
**Integrity:** MEDIUM (tampering detectable via signature verification)
**Availability:** N/A (self-contained, no central registry)

**Impact of Compromise:**
- **DID Spoofing:** Attacker creates similar-looking DID to impersonate (phishing)
- **Correlation:** DIDs are persistent pseudonyms - can be used to track agent activity across contexts

**Storage Locations:**
- Embedded in JWS tokens (`kid` header field)
- Application databases
- Public logs, blockchain records (if published)

---

## Trust Boundaries

### Boundary 1: Python ↔ C (PyNaCl/libsodium)

**Description:** Interface between Python code and PyNaCl's libsodium C library

**Trust Level:** Python code trusts libsodium for cryptographic correctness

**Security Concerns:**
- **Buffer Overflows:** Malformed inputs to PyNaCl could cause memory corruption in libsodium
- **Type Confusion:** Passing non-bytes objects could crash C layer
- **Memory Safety:** Python's garbage collector doesn't control libsodium's memory

**Mitigations (Implemented in Phase 1.1):**
- ✅ Explicit seed validation before PyNaCl calls ([core.py:66-71](../didlite/core.py#L66-L71))
- ✅ Type checks for bytes objects
- ✅ Length validation (exactly 32 bytes for seeds)
- ✅ PyNaCl library maintained by cryptography.io team (well-audited)

**Reference:** [PHASE_1.1_FINDINGS.md](PHASE_1.1_FINDINGS.md) - CRIT-1

---

### Boundary 2: Library ↔ Application Code

**Description:** Public API exposed to library users

**Trust Level:** Library does NOT trust application code to provide valid inputs

**Security Concerns:**
- **Malicious Inputs:** Application may pass malformed DIDs, seeds, JWS tokens
- **Improper Usage:** Application may misuse APIs (e.g., not verifying signatures)
- **Logging Secrets:** Application may log private keys or seeds

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation at all public APIs (Phase 1.1, 1.2)
- ✅ Clear exceptions for invalid inputs (`ValueError`, `BadSignatureError`)
- ✅ Documentation emphasizes security best practices ([.github/SECURITY.md](../.github/SECURITY.md))
- ⚠️ No logging in library (correct design - logging is application responsibility)

**Reference:** [PHASE_1.2_FINDINGS.md](PHASE_1.2_FINDINGS.md)

---

### Boundary 3: Library ↔ File System (FileKeyStore)

**Description:** File I/O for encrypted seed storage

**Trust Level:** Library does NOT trust file system contents

**Security Concerns:**
- **Path Traversal:** Attacker-controlled `identifier` could write to arbitrary paths
- **World-Readable Permissions:** Encrypted files created with insecure permissions
- **Symbolic Link Attacks:** Attacker replaces seed file with symlink to sensitive file

**Mitigations:**
- ⚠️ Weak path traversal protection (Issue #10 - MED-2, deferred)
- ✅ Uses Python's `open()` - follows symlinks but doesn't create them
- ✅ PBKDF2 + Fernet encryption protects file contents
- ❌ No explicit permission setting (relies on OS umask)

**Future Improvements:**
- Use `os.path.basename()` to strip directory traversal
- Set restrictive file permissions (0600) explicitly
- Consider `O_NOFOLLOW` flag where available

**Reference:** [PHASE_1.1_FINDINGS.md](PHASE_1.1_FINDINGS.md) - MED-2

---

### Boundary 4: Library ↔ Network (JWS Token Transmission)

**Description:** JWS tokens transmitted over network (application-managed)

**Trust Level:** Library assumes network is hostile (tokens can be intercepted/modified)

**Security Concerns:**
- **Eavesdropping:** Tokens transmitted over unencrypted channels reveal payload
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** Attacker modifies token in transit
- **Replay Attacks:** Intercepted tokens reused

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ EdDSA signature prevents tampering (verified by `verify_jws()`)
- ⚠️ No built-in replay protection (application must add `exp`, `jti`, `nonce` claims)
- ⚠️ No encryption (payloads are visible - use HTTPS/TLS at transport layer)

**Application Responsibility:**
- Use HTTPS/TLS for token transmission
- Add expiration (`exp`) claims to JWS payloads
- Implement replay attack detection (nonce tracking, token IDs)

**Reference:** [.github/SECURITY.md](../.github/SECURITY.md) - Known Limitations

---

### Boundary 5: Library ↔ Process Environment (EnvKeyStore)

**Description:** Reading seeds from environment variables

**Trust Level:** Library trusts environment variables are correctly set by operator

**Security Concerns:**
- **Process Dumping:** Environment variables visible in `/proc/<pid>/environ` on Linux
- **Subprocess Inheritance:** Child processes inherit environment (seed leakage)
- **Logging Exposure:** Shell history, CI/CD logs may capture env vars

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ Seeds stored as base64 strings (not raw bytes in env)
- ⚠️ No protection against process dumps (OS-level security required)
- ❌ EnvKeyStore error messages leak env var names (Issue #16 - LOW-3, deferred)

**Best Practices for Users:**
- Use secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Avoid echoing seeds in shell commands
- Clear sensitive env vars after process startup
- Use encrypted environment files (`.env.encrypted`)

**Reference:** [PHASE_1.4_FINDINGS.md](PHASE_1.4_FINDINGS.md) - LOW-3

  - PyNaCl's Ed25519 signature verification (libsodium)
  - Fernet's HMAC verification (cryptography library)
  - No conditional branches on secret data in didlite code
- ✅ No password comparison in didlite (Fernet handles this internally)

**Verified in Phase 1.3:**
- No timing vulnerabilities found
- "Security by delegation" - timing safety inherited from libraries

**Reference:** [PHASE_1.3_FINDINGS.md](PHASE_1.3_FINDINGS.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Wrong Type:** Non-bytes objects (strings, integers, lists)
- **Wrong Size:** 0 bytes, 31 bytes, 33 bytes, 1MB+
- **Untrusted Source:** Seeds from network, user input, files

**Impact:**
- Crashes in PyNaCl (buffer overflow, type confusion)
- Weak keys (if non-random seeds accepted)

**Mitigations (Phase 1.1):**
- ✅ Type validation (`isinstance(seed, bytes)`)
- ✅ Length validation (`len(seed) == 32`)
- ✅ Validation before PyNaCl call (protects C boundary)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Seed size validation tests
- ✅ Type error tests

**Reference:** [PHASE_1.1_FINDINGS.md](PHASE_1.1_FINDINGS.md) - CRIT-1

## Threat Scenarios

### Scenario 1: IoT Device Key Theft via Weak Password

**Attacker:** File System Attacker (low-privilege local access)

**Attack Steps:**
1. Attacker gains read access to IoT device file system (e.g., via SSH with stolen credentials)
2. Copies encrypted seed file from `~/.didlite/keys/device-001.seed`
3. Runs offline password cracking (dictionary attack, GPU-accelerated)
4. Recovers weak password (`Password123!`) after 2 hours
5. Decrypts seed using Fernet with PBKDF2-derived key
6. Imports seed into own `AgentIdentity` instance
7. Creates forged JWS tokens signed with stolen identity

**Impact:**
- Complete identity compromise
- Attacker can impersonate device indefinitely (no revocation)
- Forged sensor data, malicious commands

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (requires file access + weak password)

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ PBKDF2 slows brute-force (600,000 iterations ≈ 1 second per password)
- ⚠️ User education required (strong password enforcement)
- 🔮 Future: HSM integration eliminates file-based storage

**Risk Rating:** MEDIUM (Impact: CRITICAL, Likelihood: MEDIUM)

---

### Scenario 2: JWS Replay Attack in Smart Home

**Attacker:** Network Attacker (passive eavesdropping)

**Attack Steps:**
1. User's smart home hub sends JWS token over HTTP to unlock door:
   ```json
   {"action": "unlock", "door": "front", "timestamp": 1703001234}
   ```
2. Attacker intercepts token via Wi-Fi packet sniffing
3. Signature verification passes (token is legitimate)
4. 1 hour later, attacker replays same token
5. Door unlocks again (no expiration check)

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized access to physical location
- Replay attacks work indefinitely (no token expiration)

**Likelihood:** HIGH (if application doesn't implement replay protection)

**Mitigations:**
- ⚠️ **Application Responsibility:** Must add `exp` (expiration) claim
- ⚠️ **Application Responsibility:** Must track used tokens (nonce/JTI)
- ✅ Use HTTPS/TLS to prevent eavesdropping (best practice)

**Risk Rating:** HIGH (Impact: HIGH, Likelihood: HIGH without app-layer mitigations)

**Reference:** [.github/SECURITY.md](../.github/SECURITY.md) - Known Limitations #4

---

### Scenario 3: Path Traversal in Multi-Tenant Environment

**Attacker:** Malicious Application Developer

**Attack Steps:**
1. Attacker controls `identifier` parameter in multi-tenant system
2. Creates identity with malicious identifier:
   ```python
   store = FileKeyStore("/app/tenant_keys", password="system_pw")
   store.save_seed("../../../../etc/cron.d/backdoor", malicious_seed)
   ```
3. Path traversal bypasses weak validation
4. Writes encrypted seed to `/etc/cron.d/backdoor`
5. If seed file is valid cron syntax (unlikely but possible), achieves code execution

**Impact:**
- Arbitrary file write (limited by encryption format)
- DoS (overwriting system files)
- Potential privilege escalation

**Likelihood:** LOW (requires multi-tenant architecture + weak validation + file content constraints)

**Mitigations:**
- ⚠️ Current protection is weak (Issue #10 - MED-2, deferred)
- 🔧 Recommended fix: Use `os.path.basename(identifier)` to strip paths
- 🔧 Recommended: Validate identifier against whitelist regex (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`)

**Risk Rating:** MEDIUM (Impact: HIGH, Likelihood: LOW)

**Reference:** [PHASE_1.1_FINDINGS.md](PHASE_1.1_FINDINGS.md) - MED-2

---

### Scenario 4: Algorithm Confusion Attack (PREVENTED)

**Attacker:** Network Attacker (active MITM)

**Attack Steps:**
1. Attacker intercepts JWS token signed with EdDSA
2. Modifies header to use HMAC-SHA256 (symmetric algorithm):
   ```json
   {"alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT", "kid": "did:key:z6Mkh..."}
   ```
3. Extracts public key from DID in `kid` header
4. Uses public key as HMAC secret (known to attacker, since it's public)
5. Computes HMAC signature with public key
6. Verifier uses public key as HMAC secret (if algorithm not validated)
7. Signature verification passes (HMAC matches)

**Impact:**
- Complete signature bypass
- Attacker can forge arbitrary tokens

**Likelihood:** N/A (PREVENTED by didlite design)

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ **didlite only supports EdDSA** - no algorithm negotiation
- ✅ No algorithm parameter in `verify_jws()` - hardcoded to EdDSA
- ✅ Header `alg` field ignored (algorithm is implicit)

**Risk Rating:** N/A (ELIMINATED by design)

**Design Decision:** This is why didlite is "lite" - supporting multiple algorithms would introduce complexity and attack surface.

---

### Scenario 5: Memory Dump Key Extraction (Out of Scope)

**Attacker:** Memory Attacker (root access)

**Attack Steps:**
1. Attacker gains root access to server (via kernel exploit)
2. Dumps process memory: `gcore <pid>`
3. Searches memory dump for Ed25519 private key patterns:
   ```bash
   strings core.<pid> | grep -P '[0-9a-f]{64}'
   ```
4. Finds 32-byte seed in Python heap
5. Imports seed into own `AgentIdentity`

**Impact:**
- Complete identity compromise
- Attacker controls agent identity

**Likelihood:** HIGH (if attacker has root access)

**Mitigations:**
- ❌ **Out of Scope:** didlite cannot defend against root-level attackers
- ❌ No memory locking (Python's `mlock()` unreliable)
- ❌ No memory scrubbing (garbage collector prevents deterministic erasure)

**Risk Rating:** N/A (Out of Scope)

**Recommendation:** Use HSMs for production deployments requiring defense against host compromise

---

## Security Assumptions

### 1. PyNaCl and libsodium are Correct

**Assumption:** PyNaCl's Ed25519 implementation (via libsodium) is cryptographically secure and free of critical vulnerabilities.

**Justification:**
- libsodium is widely audited (used by Signal, Tor, Wireguard)
- PyNaCl maintained by cryptography.io (reputable security team)
- Ed25519 is NIST-approved (FIPS 186-5)

**If Violated:**
- All signatures are potentially forgeable
- Private key recovery may be possible

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Monitor PyNaCl security advisories
- Use `pip-audit` for dependency vulnerability scanning (Phase 4)

---

### 2. Python Standard Library is Secure

**Assumption:** Python's `base64`, `json`, `os`, `hashlib` modules are free of critical vulnerabilities.

**Justification:**
- Python core maintained by PSF (Python Software Foundation)
- Extensive fuzzing and testing of standard library
- Security patches released regularly

**If Violated:**
- Parsing vulnerabilities (JSON, base64) could allow DoS or RCE
- File system operations could be exploited

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Use latest Python version (3.8+)
- Monitor Python security advisories (CVEs)

---

### 3. Operating System Provides Secure Randomness

**Assumption:** `SigningKey.generate()` uses cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).

**Justification:**
- PyNaCl uses `os.urandom()` internally
- `os.urandom()` uses `/dev/urandom` on Linux, `CryptGenRandom` on Windows
- Modern OS kernels seed RNGs from hardware entropy sources

**If Violated:**
- Predictable private keys (attacker can guess keys)
- Collision attacks (multiple devices generate same key)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Ensure OS is properly configured (entropy sources enabled)
- For embedded devices, verify `/dev/random` is seeded at boot
- Consider hardware RNGs (TPM, TRNG) for high-security deployments

---

### 4. File System Permissions are Properly Configured

**Assumption:** Encrypted seed files are stored in directories with restrictive permissions (e.g., `chmod 700`).

**Justification:**
- UNIX permission model prevents unauthorized file access
- User is responsible for configuring keystore directory

**If Violated:**
- World-readable seed files allow offline brute-force attacks

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Document best practices in SECURITY.md ✅ (done)
- Consider setting file permissions explicitly in future versions
- Warn users if directory permissions are too permissive (future enhancement)

---

### 5. Passwords Used with FileKeyStore are Strong

**Assumption:** Users choose strong passwords (20+ characters, random, from password manager).

**Justification:**
- PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations) makes brute-force expensive
- Assumes users follow security best practices

**If Violated:**
- Weak passwords allow offline password cracking
- Encrypted seeds become trivially recoverable

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Document password requirements in SECURITY.md ✅ (done)
- Consider password strength validation in `FileKeyStore.__init__()` (future enhancement)
- Recommend passphrase generators (diceware)

---

### 6. Applications Verify JWS Signatures

**Assumption:** Applications using didlite call `verify_jws()` before trusting token payloads.

**Justification:**
- Library provides signature verification function
- Documentation emphasizes verification requirement

**If Violated:**
- Applications accept forged tokens
- Signature protection bypassed entirely

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Prominent documentation warnings ✅ (in SECURITY.md)
- Consider API design that makes verification mandatory (future: return `VerifiedPayload` type)
- Example code always shows verification pattern

---

### 7. Applications Implement Replay Protection

**Assumption:** Applications add expiration (`exp`), nonce (`jti`), or timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks.

**Justification:**
- JWS standard supports these claims (RFC 7519)
- Replay protection is application-layer concern, not library concern

**If Violated:**
- Intercepted tokens can be reused indefinitely
- Attacker can replay old commands

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Document replay attack risk in SECURITY.md ✅ (done)
- Provide example code with `exp` claim (in future documentation)
- Consider adding `create_jws_with_expiration()` helper function

---

### 8. Network Transport Uses TLS/HTTPS

**Assumption:** JWS tokens transmitted over encrypted channels (HTTPS, TLS, Noise Protocol).

**Justification:**
- JWS payloads are base64-encoded, not encrypted
- Signature protects integrity, not confidentiality

**If Violated:**
- Payload contents visible to eavesdroppers
- Sensitive data exposed

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Document in SECURITY.md ✅ (done)
- Warn users that JWS is not encryption
- Consider adding JWE (JSON Web Encryption) support in future (post-v1.0)

## Out of Scope

The following threats are explicitly **out of scope** for didlite's threat model:

### 1. Host/OS Compromise (Root/Kernel Access)

**Rationale:** No userspace library can defend against attackers with kernel-level privileges.

**Application Responsibility:** Use OS security features (SELinux, AppArmor), secure boot, TPMs.

---

### 2. Side-Channel Attacks (Power Analysis, EM Leaks)

**Rationale:** Physical side-channels require hardware-level mitigations (constant-power gates, EM shielding).

**Application Responsibility:** Use tamper-resistant hardware (HSMs, secure elements) for high-security deployments.

---

### 3. Blockchain/Ledger Attacks

**Rationale:** didlite uses `did:key` (self-contained), not blockchain-based DID methods (`did:ethr`, `did:ion`).

**Application Responsibility:** If using blockchain DIDs, implement separate security measures.

---

### 4. Social Engineering / Phishing

**Rationale:** Library cannot prevent users from sharing private keys or being tricked into running malicious code.

**Application Responsibility:** User education, phishing-resistant authentication (WebAuthn).

---

### 5. Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)

**Rationale:** DoS attacks are application/infrastructure concern (rate limiting, resource quotas).

**Application Responsibility:** Implement request throttling, circuit breakers, resource limits.

**Note:** Library includes input size validation to prevent trivial DoS (e.g., 1MB DIDs), but cannot prevent all resource exhaustion attacks.

---

### 6. Quantum Computing Attacks

**Rationale:** Ed25519 is not post-quantum secure. Quantum computers with sufficient qubits (future threat) can break ECDLP.

**Timeline:** NIST estimates quantum threat to ECDSA/EdDSA by 2030-2040.

**Mitigation Path:**
- Monitor NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization (FIPS 203/204/205)
- Plan migration to post-quantum signatures (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon) in didlite v2.0 (post-2030)

---

### 7. Key Revocation / Identity Recovery

**Rationale:** `did:key` identifiers are immutable - no revocation or key rotation mechanism exists by design.

**Application Responsibility:**
- Use short-lived credentials (rotate DIDs periodically)
- Implement identity recovery at application layer (multi-key schemes, social recovery)

**Future Work:** Consider `did:web` or `did:ion` support for revocable identities (post-v1.0).
